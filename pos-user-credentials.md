The Location Owner has the ability to set up information about actual POS users and deactivate them if needed. When providing access to the POS application for a POS user, the most essential part of this process is giving them the necessary credentials to enter the unTill Air application.

To enhance the organization of workflow among waiters in the POS, you can assign a unique password to each POS user, personalizing their working experience. This feature allows waiters to log in to their individual accounts in the POS, and the Back Office reports will show data for each POS user separately. This enables the Location Owner to effectively track the activity and efficiency of each POS user.

Furthermore, to ensure the safety of POS users' work, you have the option to set up 'Auto Logoff.' This feature restricts the usage of the application on the tablet beyond processing orders. After a period of inactivity in the unTill Air application, which you can specify in the Back Office, the POS user will be required to re-login to continue working in the POS.
