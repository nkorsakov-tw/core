To efficiently manage restaurant orders, it is crucial to establish key devices such as printers, terminals, and tablets.

To learn how to establish these devices, please refer to the manual specifically dedicated to device connectivity. This manual will provide you with clear instructions and guidance on adding your devices for operation within the unTill Air system.

A few steps to add a device:

1. Navigate to the **'General' > 'Equipment'.**
2. Click **'Add new equipment'**.
3. Select what kind of devices you want to establish.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: If you have not yet added a printer and terminal to your device list, you will not be able to add a tablet. Therefore, it's necessary to first add a printer and terminal before proceeding to add a tablet.
{% endhint %}

### Add new printer

1. Give a name for your new printer.
2. Please select the aim of using it.
3. Enter the technical information about your printer or choose **'Null printer'**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have a printer yet, select 'Null printer' feature to simulate the working process without printing actual receipts.
{% endhint %}

4. Click **'Save'**.

### Add new terminal

1. Give a name for your new terminal.
2. Enter the POIID for your terminal.
3. Click **'Continue'**

### Add new tablet

{% hint style="info" %}
To add a tablet to the back office, you first need to install the **'unTil Runner'** application on your device.
{% endhint %}

1. Primarily, you have the choice to select the type of tablet functionality that suits your needs. You can opt for either the ['Direct sales'](../../features/sales-modes/direct-sales-mode.md) mode or the ['Table Overview'](../../features/sales-modes/table-plan-mode.md) mode:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Direct sales" %}
This mode is intended for selling items without tables and designated spaces. It consists of a point of sale that directly sells products to customers. In this mode, you won't see spaces where orders are generated; instead, it will display a simple list of products and generate a bill for the client.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Table Plan" %}
This mode is intended for businesses with tables and dining spaces where staff interact with clients. In this mode, you will have a specific space in the POS, which can be [set up in the Back Office](../../features/spaces/manage-spaces-bo.md). You will have access to lists of orders from different tables, allowing you to efficiently manage them.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**If you have 'Direct sales' mode:**

* Specify the number of tables;
* Select the space which you'll use;
* Select the printer;
* Scan the QR Code using your tablet.

**If you have 'Table Overview':**

* Select the printer;
* Scan the QR Code using your tablet.
