# Payment methods (Card)

Payment by cash doesn't require any additional actions from the user. Cash payment is available from the first steps in unTill Air. However, cashless payment requires some additional steps, as it requires access to unTill Payments.

To enable the card as a means of payment in the POS terminal, please follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to the **'General' > 'Payment methods'**&#x20;
2. Click 'Add new payments method
3. Give a namre and number of the payment&#x20;
4. Click 'Continue'
