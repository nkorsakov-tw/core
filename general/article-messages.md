# Article messages

### What's the 'Article message'?

In the Back Office, article messages are used to specify customer needs. These messages play an important role when taking an order, as waiters may receive requests from clients regarding the preparation and service of a dish, along with additional clarifications.

These article messages serve as a means of communication between the staff in the dining space and the kitchen, ensuring that the customer's specific requirements are understood. Waiters can transfer detailed instructions or preferences from the client, such as dietary restrictions, cooking preferences etc. This helps to ensure that the dish is prepared and served exactly as desired, enhancing the overall dining experience for the customer.
