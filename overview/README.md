# Overview

unTill Air is a powerful software solution specifically designed to optimize restaurant business operations. It offers a comprehensive set of features that enable restaurant managers to track and monitor various aspects of their business in real-time.

### User roles&#x20;

Users of unTill Air can be assigned to different roles, including owners, managers and staff (waiters). Owners and managers have the ability to configure and customize the main settings, as well as access comprehensive information about the workflow in the restaurant, including reports on sales, discounts and employee performance. Staff members primarily work with devices that enable them to efficiently manage and fulfill orders, make changes to orders and provide customer service.

### Two working areas: Back Office and POS

unTill is divided into two main parts: the Back Office and the POS (Point of Sale), which both help you to effectively manage your restaurant business. The Back Office is dedicated to internal operations such as creating articles, setting up prices, and managing various aspects of the restaurant. In the Back Office, you can make changes and track the operations of your restaurant. It's primarily designed for owners and managers who utilize it for comprehensive management and informed decision-making.

The POS focuses on providing a seamless ordering and transactional experience for customers. Staff members cannot modify settings but are responsible for fulfilling orders, making adjustments, and ensuring efficient service delivery. The POS system is designed specifically for the restaurant space.

### Devices for unTill Air

For using unTill Air, you will need various devices, including printers, terminals, and tablets. These devices are configured in the Back Office before they can be used. Printers and terminals are essential for issuing receipts and processing transactions. However, tablets are primarily used by waiters, as they provide a convenient interface to track table statuses, fulfill orders, send messages to the kitchen staff with client requests, and accept payments. Tablets are specifically designed to work with the POS, enabling staff members to perform their tasks quickly and efficiently.

### unTill Payments

In unTill Air you have access to a specialized system called unTill Payments, which enables you to accept payments. With unTill Payments you can process payments internally and take advantage of its features. You have the option to connect to unTill Payments either through your reseller or directly through unTill Air.

### Add new location

One additional feature you should know is the ability to create a new location within your existing unTill Air account. There is no need to sign up again to establish a new restaurant space in unTill Air. When you subscribe to a new location, you gain full capacity to set up and manage your restaurant. This includes creating new spaces and articles, just as you would with a standard new location.
