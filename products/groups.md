# Groups

Groups are significantly important in the hierarchy of different levels, such as 'Articles' or 'Departments.' 'Groups' belong to the 'Categories' and have 'Departments.' For more detailed information about this hierarchical structure of unTill Air and the diagram dedicated to it, please [refer to the designated page.](./)

One of the specific traits of 'Groups' is their ability to define and set the VAT levels that can't be modified on other hierarchical levels. Specifically, the VAT for products is determined at the 'Group' level, providing a centralized and flexible way to manage tax settings across related items.
