You can implement a 'Combi deal' once you have already created and set it up in the Back Office. [Refer to this manual](create-a-combi-deal.md) to create and set up 'Combi deal'.
{% endhint %}

To start using the 'Combi deal' in the POS, please follow these steps:

1. Open the application 'unTill Air' on your tablet.
2. Click on the table in your space to place an order.
3. Among the articles in a department to which you have assigned the **'**Combi deal', you will see the name of your new 'Combi deal', click on it.
4. As a POS user, you have the option to select one item from each line within the 'Combi deal,' based on the customer's preferences.
