# Create an Article

The 'Articles' play a crucial role in the configuration process within the Back Office, serving as the foundational elements before their implementation in the POS. That's a reason why creating the articles is one of the most common operations in unTill Air.

To create an **'Article'**, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **'Products' > 'Articles'**.
2. Click **'Add new article'**.
3. Provide a name for your new article.
4. Set the price for this article.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a space with the 'Special price' feature and you want to set non-identical prices for one article in different spaces, you can [refer to the designated manual](../../spaces/special-price-in-a-specific-space.md) for instructions on how to do so.
{% endhint %}

5. Select a **'Department'** and **'Course'**.
6. Assign new article to the needed **'Spaces'**.

**Optional**:

* You can pick a custom color for your article, and it will be visible in the POS when the article is included in an order;
* You can add a modifier to your new article. For instructions on how to create modifiers, please [refer to the designated manual](../modifiers/create-modifiers-and-assign-them-to-the-article.md).

7. Click **'Save'** button.
