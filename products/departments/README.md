# Departments

Departments are significantly important in the hierarchy of different levels, such as 'Articles' or 'Groups.' 'Departments' belong to the 'Groups' and have 'Articles.' For more detailed information about this hierarchical structure of unTill Air and the diagram dedicated to it, please [refer to the designated page.](../)

Usually, 'Departments' include dozens of 'Articles' which eventually take a place in the order list. 'Departments' are constantly used in the POS, and they are shown when taking an order.
