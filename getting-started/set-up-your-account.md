* When you navigate to the `Spaces` page, you will find your existing spaces, which represent the areas where you accommodate your clients, such as a terrace, floor, or bar. Within each space, you can select the desired quantity of tables and specify other conditions, including the presence or absence of special pricing. By accessing the Spaces section, it implies that you have already created at least one space. From there, you can proceed to work with it, review and enhance its features, and expand it further using the same approach. You have full control over your spaces: you can delete existing spaces, create new ones, or modify conditions such as the number of tables. Additionally, you can customize visual elements to create a more realistic representation of your dining space.
