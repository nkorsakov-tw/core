# Articles

Articles are the fundamental components in the setting up your products. They represent the names of dishes and beverages listed in the products section. These articles are assigned to different departments and groups, forming the foundation for completing orders.&#x20;

When a customer places an order, the POS user can easily access the list of articles and efficiently manage the order process using this list.&#x20;

Articles can be enriched with optional additional elements that you are free to set up in the Back Office, such as modifiers (detailed instructions [can be found on the designated page](../modifiers/)). Moreover, you have the flexibility to create combi deals for specific articles, providing your customers with enticing offers and promotions (more information [can be found here](../combi-deal/)). With this variety of options, you can manage your product list to suit your restaurant's needs and enhance the ordering process in your dining space.
