# Deactivate a POS User

To **deactivate a POS User** in the Back Office, please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **'Users'**.
2. Hover over the line of the user you want to deactivate and click the 'delete' sign.

Now that the user has been deactivated, they will no longer have access to enter the POS under their own name and make any changes there. Their account privileges have been revoked, ensuring that they cannot perform any actions within the system.
