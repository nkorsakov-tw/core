# POS Users

### Who are POS users?

A POS user is an essential individual who interacts with the Point of Sale system and handles various tasks associated with sales, payments, and transactions. In a restaurant business, POS users play a crucial role as they provide services to customers, process orders, and accept payments.&#x20;

The unTill Air application serves as a valuable tool for POS users, offering a comprehensive range of features to support their workflow. From order processing to payment handling, the application centralizes all necessary functions, enabling POS users to efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibilities.

### Distinctions of working for POS users in the different modes

In unTill Air, POS users can work with 'Spaces' and tables in the 'Table Plan' mode, allowing them to efficiently manage orders and assign them to specific tables for a more organized working process. Conversely, in the 'Direct Sales' mode, POS users can quickly process orders without the need for table assignments, making it ideal for businesses that don't have physical 'Spaces'.
