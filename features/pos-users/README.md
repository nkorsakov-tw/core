# POS Users

### Who are POS users?

POS user is an essential individual who interacts with the Point of Sale system and handles various tasks associated with sales, payments, and transactions. In a restaurant business, POS users play a crucial role as they provide services to customers, process orders, and accept payments.&#x20;

The unTill Air application serves as a valuable tool for POS users, offering a comprehensive range of features to support their workflow. From order processing to payment handling, the application centralizes all necessary functions, enabling POS users to efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibilities.

### Distinctions of working for POS users in the different modes

In unTill Air, POS users can work with **'Spaces'** and tables in the **'Table Plan'** mode, allowing them to efficiently manage orders and assign them to specific tables for a more organized working process. Conversely, in the **'Direct Sales'** mode, POS users can quickly process orders without the need for table assignments, making it ideal for businesses that don't have physical **'Spaces'**.

### POS user performance

As a Location Owner, you have the valuable ability to track and evaluate your waiters' performance in the Back Office. Detailed reports offer insights into various aspects of their interactions with clients, such as discounts, voids, and more. This information empowers you to make informed decisions and configure an efficient system to enhance the overall service quality.&#x20;

### POS user devices

The most frequently used device for POS users is a tablet. With the help of a tablet, POS users can efficiently carry out their daily duties and keep the Location Owner informed about the restaurant's financial situation by sending [X Reports](../../reports/x-reports.md) and [Z Reports](../../reports/z-reports.md) from the POS.

Additionally, POS users manage other essential devices for the restaurant business, such as terminals and printers. These devices can be set up by the Location Owner in the Back Office in the same way as a tablet.
