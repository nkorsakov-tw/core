# Add new screen

In unTill Air screens are the POS tablets that are actively connected and used in our services. When subscribing to unTill Air, you have the option to choose the number of screens you can use. However, it's important to note that there are limits to the number of screens based on the subscription plan you select.

If you find the need to add a new tablet to your account and the current subscription's limit doesn't allow for it, this manual will provide you with clear instructions on how to add more screens by renewing your subscription.

To add a new screen to your account, please follow these steps:

1. From any page in unTill Air, you can access your account-related options and settings by tapping on the user account icon located in the top-right corner.
