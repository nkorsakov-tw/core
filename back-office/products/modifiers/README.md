# Modifiers

Modifiers are necessary for users to enable their customers to add certain ingredients or make changes to a dish or drink. This feature significantly increases flexibility and customer satisfaction by allowing them to personalize their orders. This helps to create a more delicious and individual product that meets the specific preferences of each individual customer.

Implementing a system of modifiers provides a useful tool for users to accommodate various dietary restrictions, preferences, and individual tastes.
