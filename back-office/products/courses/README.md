# Courses

In a restaurant, the order in which dishes are served to customers follows a certain sequence, ensuring a smooth dining experience. To facilitate this, the 'Courses' feature in unTill Air allows managers to categorize articles into different parts or courses. These courses typically include starters, main dishes, and desserts.

By dividing the menu into courses, owners can effectively organize the serving process and ensure that dishes are served in the appropriate order.

The POS user, such as a waiter, has the ability to fit the course sequence based on the customer's preferences. In cases where a customer wishes to skip a particular course and proceed directly to the next one, the waiter can utilize the 'Fire next course' button in the POS. This functionality allows the waiter to seamlessly move to the next course, accommodating the customer's request and ensuring a personalized dining experience.&#x20;

Courses in unTill Air assume the visual clarity and guidance for POS users (waiters). Each course is assigned a distinct color, allowing for quick and intuitive identification during the order-taking and serving process.&#x20;
