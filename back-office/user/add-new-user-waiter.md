Since the launch you already have at least one user (waiter), but let's look at how to add or remove other users.

To add new user follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **'Users'** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **'Add new user'.**
3. Provide the information about user.
4. Pay the attention to different options:

* **Allow void**
* **Allow transfer**

If you trust your stuff and can afford them making a voids and transfers, you are able to give the access for waiters to these features.

5. Click **'Save' button'**.
