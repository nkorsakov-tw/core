# Set up VAT levels

In unTill Air, we provide default VAT levels such as Standard, Reduced, and Zero. However, it's important to note that different countries may have varying VAT rates. For instance, in Sweden, the standard VAT rate is 25%, while in Germany, it's 19%. Therefore, it is recommended to manage and set up VAT levels with their corresponding percentage rates according to your specific region or country.
