# Reasons

### What are 'Reasons'?

'Reasons' in unTill Air are brief reports that provide information about voids and discounts. POS users can utilize 'Reasons' to notify the manager about the reasons behind void or performed discounts.&#x20;

The process for using 'Reasons' is straightforward. It allows for either a custom message to be entered directly by the waiter in the POS or the creation of preconfigured reasons that are visible in the POS. These preconfigured reasons can be selected and applied when recording a discount or void transaction in the POS. They become available for use in the POS once the discount or void is acknowledged.
