# Back Office Intro

The Back Office serves as the central hub for managing your business. From the Back Office you can make changes that will be reflected in the Point of Sale (POS) system and access comprehensive information about your business.

Within the Back Office you have the ability to modify and add products to your inventory, create menus, and set up discounts. It also enables you to add users (staff members) to your account, allowing for collaboration and user-specific access levels. Additionally, you can connect and manage various devices associated with your account.

One of the key features of the Back Office is the capability to create and customize spaces. These spaces provide a visual representation of your table areas, where your staff can efficiently receive and serve clients. By customizing these spaces, you can optimize the layout and organization of your establishment.

The Back Office empowers you to clearly comprehend operations, maintain control over your business, and enhance the overall efficiency of your workflow. These functionalities make it a vital tool for managing and optimizing various aspects of your business operations.&#x20;
